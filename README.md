# Yiyi-dApp

Welcome to the Yiyi-dApp repository - a Web3 project designed to facilitate seamless interaction with Ethereum smart contracts. The Yiyi-dApp serves as a decentralized application enabling users to execute transactions, query smart contract states, and engage with the Ethereum blockchain in a secure and intuitive manner.

## Description

Yiyi-dApp leverages the power of Web3.js and smart contract technology to provide a highly responsive and user-friendly interface for blockchain-related operations. This project is perfect for those who seek to understand the mechanics of dApps or to bootstrap their own Web3 projects using a solid foundation.

Whether you're a developer eager to dive into dApp creation or a user interested in exploring the decentralized web, Yiyi-dApp offers you a window into the world of Ethereum and decentralized technologies.

## Features

- Connect with Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Interact with smart contracts: read data and write transactions
- Subscribe to smart contract events for real-time updates
- Responsive design that adapts to different device screens
- Support for Ethereum mainnet and testnets

## Getting Started

To run Yiyi-dApp locally, you'll need a few things set up first. Below is the installation guide.

### Prerequisites

Before installing, please make sure you have the following:

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or later): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
